## Code Portfolio

This repository is a collection of projects and code samples I've worked on for classes, internships, and personal learning. This is not my main portfolio as this is just a space to share technical work and examples. 

### What's In Here
- Coursework projects
- GIS, data, and visualization-related code

### Notes
Each folder includes its own README or comments where helpful. 

### About Me
I am a GIS student with interests in environmental planning, spatial analysis, and data visualization. This repo reflects my learning process as much as my finished work.
